Please follow modern best practices and create clean, maintainable code focusing on excellent UI/UX.  always use  latest methodologies. Thanks.

Cyre is a reactive event/state managment library package for NPM.
- analyse project for logical and technical error
- use modern and latest functional typescript, 
- SOLID principals,
- minimise overlaps and duplicates 
- clear separation of concern. 
- Reserve my tag comments, descriptions and logics at the top of pages after imports. 
- use file location comments at top of pages for project structure, add on new page.
- No OOP, no Classes. use functional programming.
- make sure new updates won't break test or update test
- strict typescript 
- src/types/ for interface and types. keep it organised
- I don't want "fixed", emojis or "enhanced" comments or file names. keep original 
- stop using enhanced, optimised, fixed, etc.. prefix and suffix ... its confusing!
- should pre-compure, proactive and compile to minimise runtime overhead
