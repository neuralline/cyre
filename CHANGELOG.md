# Changelog

## 4.0.0 (2025-05-19)

### Breaking Changes

#### Logic realignment

- **Interval Execution**: First execution now waits for the interval instead of executing immediately

  - This aligns with JavaScript's `setInterval` behavior and creates a more predictable timing model
  - Example: `{interval: 1000, repeat: 3}` now waits 1000ms before first execution

  ```typescript
  // v4.0 behavior:
  // Would execute at 1s, then at 2s, then at 3s (3 total executions)
  cyre.action({id: 'refresh', interval: 1000, repeat: 3})
  cyre.call('refresh') // First execution happens after waiting 1000ms
  ```

- **Repeat Count Definition**: `repeat` now specifies the TOTAL number of executions

  - `repeat: 3` means execute exactly 3 times total (previously could result in 4 executions)
  - `repeat: 1` means execute exactly once after the interval
  - `repeat: 0` means do not execute (new behavior)

  ```typescript
  // v4.0 behavior:
  // Executes exactly 3 times total
  cyre.action({id: 'task', interval: 1000, repeat: 3})
  cyre.call('task')

  // v4.0 - zero repeat behavior:
  cyre.action({id: 'register-only', interval: 1000, repeat: 0})
  cyre.call('register-only') // Nothing happens, action is registered but not executed
  ```

- **Delay**: delay only affects the initial execution. overwrites interval (new behavior)

  - `{delay: 500}` = Wait 500ms, execute
  - `{delay: 0}` = Wait 0ms, execute after waiting 0ms (new behavior)

  ```typescript
  // v4.0 behavior:
  cyre.action({id: 'immediate', delay: 0})
  cyre.call('immediate') // Executes immediately (after 0ms)

  cyre.action({id: 'delayed', delay: 500})
  cyre.call('delayed') // Executes after 500ms
  ```

- **Combined Delay and Interval**: delay acts as initial wait, then intervals take over

  - `{delay: 500, interval: 1000, repeat: 3}` = Wait 500ms, execute, wait 1000ms, execute, wait 1000ms, execute
  - `{delay: 0, interval: 1000, repeat: 3}` = Wait 0ms, execute, wait 1000ms, execute, wait 1000ms, execute

  ```typescript
  // v4.0 - delay + interval combined:
  cyre.action({id: 'combined', delay: 500, interval: 1000, repeat: 3})
  cyre.call('combined')
  // Execution timeline:
  // 500ms: First execution
  // 1500ms: Second execution (+1000ms interval)
  // 2500ms: Third execution (+1000ms interval)
  ```

- **Channels with intervals**: Cyre does not run the same instance of channel with same id in parallel. it queues.

  ```typescript
  // If you call the same action multiple times:
  cyre.action({id: 'sequential', interval: 1000, repeat: 3})
  cyre.call('sequential', {value: 'A'}) // Queues 3 executions of A
  cyre.call('sequential', {value: 'B'}) // Queues 3 executions of B after A completes
  ```

- **Edge case scenarios**: Cyre handles priority between timing options

  ```typescript
  // Priority order for timing options:
  // 1. Delay (if specified)
  // 2. Interval
  // 3. Default immediate execution

  cyre.action({
    id: 'priority-test',
    delay: 500, // Takes precedence for initial execution
    interval: 1000, // Used for subsequent executions
    repeat: 3
  })

  // Result: Wait 500ms → Execute → Wait 1000ms → Execute → Wait 1000ms → Execute
  ```

## Migration Guide

### Updating from v3.x to v4.0

The primary breaking change is in how interval actions are executed. If your code depends on interval actions executing immediately, you'll need to adjust your approach:

**New approach (v4.0):**

use delay for immediate execution:

```typescript
// Immediate + interval pattern
cyre.action({
  id: 'interval-action',
  delay: 0, // Execute immediately
  interval: 5000, // Then every 5 seconds
  repeat: true
})
```

## New Cyre Hook Usage

The new `useCyre` hook makes it easy to work with Cyre in React applications:

```typescript
import {useCyre} from 'cyre'

function UserComponent() {
  const userChannel = useCyre({
    name: 'user',
    protection: {
      debounce: 300,
      detectChanges: true
    }
  })

  // Subscribe to channel events
  React.useEffect(() => {
    const subscription = userChannel.on(userData => {
      console.log('User updated:', userData)
    })

    // Cleanup when component unmounts
    return () => subscription.unsubscribe()
  }, [])

  // Call the channel
  const handleUserUpdate = userData => {
    userChannel.call(userData)
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={() => handleUserUpdate({id: 123, name: 'John'})}>
      Update User
    </button>
  )
}
```
