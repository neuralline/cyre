## Hotpath Analysis

### Execution Path Overhead Breakdown

The `.call` to `.on` handler execution path includes:

1. **call()** → Input validation, action lookup
2. **processCall()** → Pipeline execution, scheduling logic
3. **useDispatch()** → Handler routing, execution strategy
4. **executeSingleHandler()** → Performance monitoring, metrics
5. **handler()** → Actual user code execution

### Overhead Sources

1. **Promise/Async overhead**: ~20-30% (unavoidable for async operations)
2. **Object creation**: ~10-15% (response objects, metadata)
3. **State management**: ~5-10% (metrics, payload history)
4. **Function call overhead**: ~5-10% (routing, validation)
5. **Feature overhead**: ~40-50% (debounce, buffer, pipeline capabilities)

## Optimization Opportunities

### High-Impact Optimizations

1. **Pre-compiled execution paths**

   - Cache optimized execution strategies
   - Reduce runtime decision making

2. **Object pooling**

   - Reuse response objects
   - Minimize garbage collection

3. **Inline critical paths**

   - Optimize single handler case
   - Reduce function call overhead

4. **Reduce Promise allocations**
   - Use sync paths where possible
   - Optimize async/await patterns

### Expected Improvements

With optimizations, Cyre could potentially reach:

- **300k-500k ops/sec** for optimized hot paths
- **150k-200k ops/sec** for feature-rich paths
- **50-70% reduction** in overhead

## Real-World Performance

### Use Case Analysis

| Use Case             | Frequency      | Cyre Performance | Assessment            |
| -------------------- | -------------- | ---------------- | --------------------- |
| User input events    | 10-100/sec     | ✅ Excellent     | 1000x headroom        |
| Real-time updates    | 100-1000/sec   | ✅ Excellent     | 100x headroom         |
| High-frequency data  | 1000-10000/sec | ✅ Good          | 10x headroom          |
| Ultra-high frequency | 10000+/sec     | ⚠️ Monitor       | Consider optimization |
