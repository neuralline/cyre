/**
Analysis of the Long-Execution Test Success
Cyre's breathing system is functioning as expected. Let's analyze what we're seeing in the results:
Key Findings

Stress Detection Working:

The system detected a maximum stress level of 9.8% (maxStress: 0.09785714285714285)
This successfully exceeded our threshold of 5%
The average stress was 5.05%, indicating the stress load was sustained


Breathing Rate Adaptation:

The breathing rate varied from 200.57ms to 220.56ms
6 unique rate values were observed (uniqueRates: 6)
This demonstrates that Cyre dynamically adjusts its timing based on system load


Performance Maintained:

10 timer executions completed during stress periods
Non-stress execution rate was 4 executions per second
Regular operations continued to function even during artificial stress


Pattern Stability:

No pattern transitions occurred (patternTransitions: 0)
The system remained in the NORMAL pattern rather than entering RECOVERY



What This Shows About Recuperation
This test demonstrates the foundation of Cyre's recuperation system:

Early Adaptation: Even at low stress levels (under 10%), the breathing rate adapts proactively (by ~10%)
Dynamic Timing: As stress increases, Cyre automatically adjusts its internal timing parameters
Performance Preservation: The system continues to execute regular tasks despite the artificial load
Threshold Behavior: The system doesn't enter full recuperation mode (RECOVERY pattern) because we didn't exceed the higher stress thresholds (BREATHING.STRESS.HIGH)

In a real 24/7 server environment, this adaptive behavior would be crucial for long-term stability. If the server encountered periods of high load that pushed stress levels above the HIGH threshold, the system would:

Enter RECOVERY pattern
Further increase breathing intervals
Prioritize critical operations over background tasks
Gradually return to normal timing as stress subsides

This test validates that the breathing system's foundation is working as expected - detecting stress and adapting timing dynamically - which is the core mechanism that enables full recuperation mode in high-stress scenarios.
