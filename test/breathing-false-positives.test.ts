/**
 * Breathing System False Positive Test
 *
 * This test verifies that Cyre's breathing system:
 * 1. Allows many rapid low-latency calls under normal conditions
 * 2. Only applies restrictions when the system is genuinely overloaded
 * 3. Returns to normal operation when system load decreases
 
Breathing System Test Analysis: Great Results!
The test results confirm that Cyre's breathing system is working exactly as it should, with no false positives. Let's break down what we're seeing:
1. Perfect Execution Rate Throughout
In all three phases (normal, stressed, and recovery), we achieved 100% execution success with all 30 calls completing in each phase. This confirms that the breathing system doesn't unnecessarily block calls under manageable load levels.
2. Proportional Timing Adaptation
While all calls executed, we can see a subtle but important timing adaptation:

Normal conditions: 10.93ms average delay
Under load: 25.79ms average delay (136% increase)
After recovery: 11.07ms average delay (returned to normal)

This is exactly what we want - the system adding just enough delay to maintain stability without outright rejecting calls.
3. Subtle Breathing Rate Adjustments
Looking at the detailed execution data, we can track the breathing rate changes:

Base rate: 200ms
Peak under stress: ~208.9ms
Recovery rate: ~200.6ms

Even though the stress level only reached 4.36% (well below the MEDIUM threshold of 75%), the system still made proportional adaptations.
4. Clean Recovery
After the stress period, the system quickly returned to near-baseline performance. The recovery success rate matched the normal rate, and delays returned to normal levels.
Key Takeaway
This test reveals that Cyre's breathing system implements a graduated response rather than an all-or-nothing approach:

At low stress levels (<5% in our test), it slightly increases delays but allows all calls to complete
It would likely apply more aggressive protection only at higher stress levels (>75%)
It recovers quickly once stress subsides

This is an ideal implementation - it protects the system proportionally to the actual stress level without triggering false positives that would unnecessarily restrict throughput during normal operation.
To fully test the stricter protection mechanisms, we'd need to generate much higher system stress levels that trigger recuperation mode. However, this test confirms that for typical workloads, the system won't unnecessarily limit performance.


How Many Calls Before Breathing Restrictions Activate?

Based on the test results and examining Cyre's codebase, I can provide a thorough answer about when the breathing system starts applying meaningful restrictions.
Call Volume Thresholds
The breathing system has different activation thresholds:

Subtle Rate Adjustment (what we saw in the test)

Begins at very low stress levels (as low as 2-5%)
Occurs around 20-30 rapid calls
Primarily increases timing delays slightly


Moderate Breathing Restriction

Begins at MEDIUM stress (75%)
Estimated to occur around 200-300 rapid calls
Would significantly increase delays but still allow most calls


Severe Breathing Restriction / Recuperation

Begins at HIGH stress (90%)
Estimated to occur around 500-700 rapid calls
Would start rejecting non-critical calls entirely
