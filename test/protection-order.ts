  /**
   * Tests the interaction of all protection mechanisms when used together.
   *
   * The protection mechanisms in CYRE are applied in this effective order:
   * 1. Debounce: Delays execution until after a period of inactivity
   * 2. Throttle: Limits execution frequency based on last execution time
   * 3. DetectChanges: Prevents execution if payload hasn't changed
   * 4. Delay: Postpones execution by a fixed amount of time
   *
   * NOTE ON COMPLEX INTERACTIONS:
   * When combining throttle and debounce, there's a subtle behavior:
   * - Throttle checks against the time of last EXECUTION (not last call)
   * - Debounce delays the execution into the future
   * - This means a throttled action might still be debounced if no execution
   *   has happened yet, as throttle only rejects based on execution history
   *
   * This test verifies this complex interaction pattern.
